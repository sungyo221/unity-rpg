Thanks for purchase uCompass Bar.

For the complete documentation you can check it online in: http://lovattostudio.com/documentations/ucompass/
or use the local one that comes with the package, simple unzip the "documentation" file outside the unity project.

Get Started:

Import the uCompass Bar package from the asset store.
Open the scene where you wanna add the compass UI.
if you don't have a canvas in the scene create one, right click on the hierarchy window -> UI -> Canvas.
Drag inside of canvas one of the uCompass prefabs (any of those) located in: Assets -> UCompassBar -> Content -> Prefabs -> *.
Now you are ready for the integration (see complete documentation).

If you have any problem or question feel free to contact us:
